      <description>I play in a fantasy football league with 11 of my closest friends. A constant headache for everyone is the user experience of ESPN’s fantasy football site. Looking up information about our league history is especially challenging. As a result we end up with disjointed communications dispersed across email, slack, text, etc.. Our commissioners do their best to keep a spreadsheet, but it can be tedious, and the rest of us don’t see updates in real-time.</description>
