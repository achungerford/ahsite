# Problems

One thing I'm noticing is that when I create a new post using the blogdown add-in each post is created as *subdirectory* in `./content/blog` but the posts don't render on the blog after saving or after building `blogdown::build_site()`.

On the other hand, the posts that go directly into the `./content/blog` but do not go into a subdirectory render correctly on the `blog` page.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
# podium placement
first <- c("Mik", "Nate", "Nate", "Chris", "Nate", "Nate", "Dave", "Dave")
second <- c("Jon", "Alex", "Ian", "Ross", "Jon", "Chris", "Jon", "Jon")
third <- c("Katz", "Katz", "Jack", "Dave", "Katz", "Katz", "Chris", "Ross")

podium <- tibble(year, first, second, third)
podium

```
